<a id="welcome-to-tasksoup" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-tasksoup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to TaskSoup</h3>

<p>TaskSoup is an easy to use, simple project management tool for agile teams. TaskSoup focuses on simplicity, both in user experience and in code. Simplicity is not the same as easy-of-use. Some people might find TaskSoup clunky or old-school and that's just fine with us. Simplicity is about predictability and understanding. Everyone can understand the way TaskSoup works. TaskSoup tries to keep the workflow processes as explicit as possible. Sometimes this leads to a less elegant user interface but again, we don't care because the focus is on Simplicity. TaskSoup also does not offer a lot of eye-candy, it has a simple design that looks the same on most devices and browsers. The entire source code is about 500 lines of PHP code and 80 lines of JavaScript. We try to keep TaskSoup small and compact and we won't implement many new features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="system-requirements" class="anchor" href="#system-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>System Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>PHP 5.3.4 or higher</li>
<li>Webserver (Apache2, NGINX or whatever...)</li>
<li>SQLite 3</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="how-to-install-tasksoup" class="anchor" href="#how-to-install-tasksoup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to install TaskSoup</h3>

<p>Download the package from this website and extract the contents into the destination folder.
Point your webserver to the location of the destination folder.</p>

<p>TaskSoup does not rely on so-called beautiful routes, so you don't need URL rewriting capabilities: no need for .htaccess files or URL remapping configurations in your webserver.</p>

<p>TaskSoup does not require a MySQL database. Instead it uses SQLite3, a file-based database.
For your convenience we offer a little shell script that can create the database for you, simply run the following command in the TaskSoup destination folder:</p>

<p><code>sh create_database.sh</code></p>

<p>If for some reason that does not work, just create an SQLite3 database yourself:</p>

<p><code>mkdir database</code>
<code>touch database/data.sql</code></p>

<p>and open your favourite SQLite3 database management program and paste the SQL in schema.sql in the SQL editor.</p>

<p>When you have configured your database correctly you are ready to use TaskSoup.
Open your favourite web browser and enter the URL associated the destination folder on your server. Everything should work now.</p>

<h3>
<a id="using-a-different-database" class="anchor" href="#using-a-different-database" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using a different database</h3>

<p>You can use a different database by changing the database connection string in the source code.
The source code file has been designed to be readable and editable by administrators. You'll find comments pointing to configurable values. This is another example of keeping things simple. Instead of all kinds of fuzzy installers and setup software you can simply edit the index.php file if needed.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authentication" class="anchor" href="#authentication" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authentication</h3>

<p>By default TaskSoup does not need user accounts or protection. It is assumed you either run it in a private environment or you want to add your own authentication.</p>

<p>By default, TaskSoup tries to include a file called auth.php in the same folder. If this file does not exist, nothing happens and TaskSoup will just run.</p>

<p>You can put whatever kind of authentication you like in that file. For details on how to create a super simple basic authentication take a look at: <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/features.http-auth.php">http://php.net/manual/en/features.http-auth.php</a></p>

<h3>
<a id="using-tasksoup" class="anchor" href="#using-tasksoup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using TaskSoup</h3>

<p>To Start using TaskSoup you need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a Team</li>
<li>Add users to the team</li>
<li>Create one or more periods</li>
<li>Add tasks to the periods</li>
</ol>

<h5>
<a id="create-a-team" class="anchor" href="#create-a-team" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Create a Team</h5>

<p>To create a new team click on the 'ADD TEAM' button in the upper toolbar of the screen.
You can now enter the name of the team as well as a description.</p>

<h5>
<a id="add-users-team-members" class="anchor" href="#add-users-team-members" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Add Users, Team members</h5>

<p>To add a team member, click on 'ADD USER' in the upper toolbar. This will open a new screen with the team member form. You can now fill in the details about the new team member.</p>

<p>First fill in the name, this is supposed to be the real name of the team member. This name is not displayed throughout the application though, it's for administration only.</p>

<p>The next field is for the display name or nickname. Use a short version of the full name for this. For instance if your full name is 'Hercule Poirot' you might opt for 'Poirot' as a display names. In certain teams nicknames are more common.</p>

<p>The next field is for the email address of the new team member, this field is optional. The e-mail address will not be shown throughout the application.</p>

<p>The next field is for the phone number of the new team member, this field is also optional and like the previous one whatever you enter here will remain private as well.</p>

<p>Be careful when entering personal details like email and phone, if you fill in these fields you might want to make sure you have an Authentication Module or the system runs in a private environment, otherwise your personal data might be harvested for spam mailings.</p>

<p>The photo field is also optional. TaskSoup will use this URL to display a picture associated with this team member when he or she is working on a task. So, while this information is optional it really improves the effectiveness of the tool and should therefore be supplied. Please note that not all photos and pictures are generally available. You might need to check if the picture can be retrieved by TaskSoup.</p>

<p>The Team field on the right is the last field that needs to be filled in. You can select multiple teams to participate in by using the CTRL key or the SHIFT key.</p>
